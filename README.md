# Plots-and-code-for-TA
This repo will have codes and plots that I will be using or used in my TA classes.

Right now I'm a TA in macro, so all new work will be either python code for graphs / data analysis or LaTex code for my notes.

Price theory folder is just me experementing with drawing and plotting indifference curves plus I thought at first I would be TA'ing for price theory.
